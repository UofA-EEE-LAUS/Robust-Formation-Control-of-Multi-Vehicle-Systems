Detection files:
ATF for Alpha trimmer filter
Kalman filter for kalman filter
CF for Complementary filter
Framebyframe for Object classification by YOLOv3
Py_vrep is the main script

Cfg files and weights files are too large for Git, you can find them on my google drive here:
Tiny weights are for YOLOv3 tiny, these are really useful for CPU only operation
if you have a Nvidia GPU, you can use the full weights for increased detection rates
